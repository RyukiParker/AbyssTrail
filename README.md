# Abyss Trail

Oregon Trail but in the ocean

**Goal** of the game is to reach the bottom of the ocean (for now)

Over the course of weeks/months, the player will control a sub to different forts and bases for missions and upgrades, and fight or capture sea creatures encountered to keep descending into the abyss.

Look at Trello for specific details
